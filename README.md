# Orion Antivirus | Henry Shires
A file-based antivirus that contains a list of MD5 hashes from known malware, compares them with a selected file, and determines if it's malware. The user then has the option to delete the file from the computer.

Latest Release: https://github.com/hcshires/Orion-Antivirus/releases/latest

## Use Orion Antivirus to:
- Browse for a file to scan
- Orion Antivirus will automatically determine if it is infected

## Features
- Relatively fast scanner algorithm
- Complete deletion of infected files

The Algorithm consists of generating an MD5 hash checksum for the user's file and comparing it with a list of known malware MD5 hashes in a text file. This program is open source and free to download and use on Windows machines with .NET 4.6.1 or higher.
